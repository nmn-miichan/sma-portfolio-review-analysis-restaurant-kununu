    "- Kununu's website uses JavaScript to load content dynamically, meaning simple HTTP requests won't capture all the data. The original project used Scraping Bee to address this issue. I replaced it with Selenium, a free alternative that we learned in the lecture."

The data quality in terms of completeness and consistency of the review is not secured, it depends a lot on the individual biases and subjectivity. This requires us to handle the data differently than traditional tabular data, by using special NLP techniques. This aspect makes it particularly interesting in the context of our course.\n",
